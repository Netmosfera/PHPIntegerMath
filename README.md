# PHP Integer Math

## Installation:

The following installs the PHP stubs and the tests, other than enforcing the dependency
of the extension in Composer:

```
composer require netmosfera/integer-math
```

To compile the extension, clone this repo to the `ext` folder and add
`--enable-integer-math` to the `configure` command when compiling PHP.
